![Design preview for the Recipe page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## 🧑‍🍳 Overview

This is my solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). The goal was to build a responsive recipe page based on the provided design using HTML and CSS.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (custom properties, Flexbox)
- Google Fonts (`Young Serif`, `Outfit`)
- Mobile-first design
- Responsive layout without media queries (using relative units like `%`, `rem`, and `clamp()`)
  
---

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to build a responsive layout **without media queries** by using:
  - `width: 100%` + `max-width`
  - `clamp()` for fluid typography and spacing
  - Flexbox layout with wrapping and spacing
- Improved understanding of semantic HTML (like using `<section>`, `<article>`, `<table>`, etc.)
- Better typography handling using Google Fonts and color variables

---

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- Getting the image and content to scale well on small mobile screens
- Making the layout visually balanced on large desktop screens (1440px) without breakpoints
- Styling `<table>` data in a modern, clean way

---

## ❓ Areas I’d Like Feedback On

- My approach to responsiveness using only relative units (`clamp()`, `%`, `rem`)
- Any improvements on the semantic structure of my HTML
- Suggestions to simplify or modularize my CSS structure
